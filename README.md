# Car-Seat-Weight-Reduction

1.Analysed car seat components such as Slider Assembly and Handrest Foam for their effective weight reduction.  

2.Implemented Pugh analysis for material and design optimization, achieving maximum weight reduction with Al SiC composite and layered PU foam for each component, while maintaining their mechanical properties.

3.The maximum weight reduction achieved was 2.5kg per seat which potentially leads to 12.5g/km CO2 reduction
